# MIDI clip cutting issue

Cutting across a note with per-note automation can be done three ways:

1. Don't cut
2. Do a soft cut
3. Do a hard cut, give both notes the same automation (Currently implemented)
    - There was an issue of linked automation, as I understand it, but that's been fixed
        - Somewhat related: https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/issues/5940

# BB clips

https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/pull/7559 should be tested and merged after this.

# Existing issues discovered in PR

If issues to these don't exist, I'll open them.

- TextBox for resizing pops up at the end of the clip, even when it's out of bounds
- The knife marker moves when zooming
- When a sample track is loaded into a sample clip, it's only as big as the clip was. This is good. However, a context menu option such as "Expand clip to full sample length" would be great!
- It would be nice if a knife tool applied to a clip a selection was previously made would invalidate the selection and make the cut
- "Esc" to disable a knife cut would be good.
- Gray clips don't show the name of the clip. This would be beneficial, as you could keep the name as a TODO note as to what the clip should be (eg. main melody, bassline, etc).

# Future plans

- BB note view (https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/pull/7559) [Heavily recommended]
- Resizing clips in bulk [Optional]
- Make it so selected clips are all cut together [Optional]
