# Notes

- MIDI clips
	- Cutting across a note with per-note automation can be done three ways:
		1. Don't cut
		2. Do a soft cut
		3. **Do a hard cut, give both notes the same automation**
			- This is a known issue: https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/issues/5940

- BB clips
	- Cutting BB clips is problematic because you can't tell where a cut has been made.
		- There are three ways to solve this:
			1. Don't implement BB cutting
			2. Add gray areas to BB clips (Not possible, BB clips are not unique, like MIDI clips are)
			3. **Keep BB cutting as it is now, but add https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/pull/7559 so it's easier to comprehend**

The bolded ones are implemented.

# TODO

- [x] Cutting leaves the cut line in the clip, visible after resizing or zooming
- [x] Address the issue of cutting across a pitch-bent note
	- It's an existing issue regarding detune copying (https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/issues/5940)
- [x] Address the issue of BB clip cutting ambiguity
	- Keep as it is, follow this PR up with https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/pull/7559
- [x] Address the issue of detuning copying
	- Work on the issue in the future (https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/issues/5940)

# Existing issues discovered in PR

- TextBox for resizing pops up at the end of the clip, even when it's out of bounds
- The knife marker moves when zooming
- It would be nice if a knife tool applied to a clip a selection was previously made would invalidate the selection and make the cut

While not discovered, https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/issues/5940 now creates potential issues when cutting bent notes.
