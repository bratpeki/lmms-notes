https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/pull/7477:

- MIDI clips
	- Cutting across a note with per-note automation can be done three ways:
		1. Don't cut
		2. Do a soft cut
		3. Do a hard cut, give both notes the same automation
			- This is a known issue: https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/issues/5940

- BB clips
	- Cutting BB clips is problematic because you can't tell where a cut has been made.
		- There are three ways to solve this:
			1. Don't implement BB cutting
			2. Add gray areas to BB clips (Not possible, BB clips are not unique, like MIDI clips are)
			3. Keep BB cutting as it is now, but add https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/pull/7559 so it's easier to comprehend

TODO:

- [x] Cutting leaves the cut line in the clip, visible after resizing or zooming

- [ ] Address the issue of cutting across a pitch-bent note
- [ ] Address the issue of detuning copying
- [ ] Address the issue of BB clip cutting ambiguity

Post:

- TextBox for resizing pops up at the end of the clip, even when it's out of bounds
- The knife marker moves when zooming
- It would be nice if a knife tool applied to a clip a selection was previously made would invalidate the selection and make the cut
